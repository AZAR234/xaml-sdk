## Geocode
The RadMap provides unified geocoding architecture, incorporated in the BingRestMapProvider SearchLocation API.
This allows you to easily convert a location point to an address and the opposite - address to a location point.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
