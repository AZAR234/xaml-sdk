## View Modes Setting View Mode
The RadMap allows you to bring the map in several view modes. After setting the desired view mode, the user is also capable of changing the view, depending on his/her needs. He/She can do it via the button with the eye-like icon, which represents the command bar.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
