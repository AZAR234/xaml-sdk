## Information Layer Framework Elements
One of the objects that can be displayed inside the InformationLayer is the FrameworkElement. This means that you can actually display anything inside the InformationLayer. If you want to compose more than one control for your element, you just have to wrap them inside one of the layout controls.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
