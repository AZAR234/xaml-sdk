## View Modes External Map Command Bar
You can use the MapCommandBar control outside the RadMap control. In order to associate the external MapCommandBar control and the RadMap instance, set the MapControl property of MapCommandBar to the respective RadMap instance.
You can configure the RadMap control not to show its default MapCommandBar control using its CommandBarVisibility property or the UseDefaultLayout property that disables the default layout of RadMap.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
