## Information Layer Pin Points
The MapPinPoint class is designed to represent Point objects from KML files. However, it can be also used outside the KML context in order to mark points of interest (POIs) or something else.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
